When reviewing the classification report of the baseline algorithm, there are a number of data point to be derived. First, the model had a high recall when buying long of 96% and low recall when selling short of 4%. In turn, the accuracy when buying long was 56% and 43% when selling short. The model does a better job when predicting to buy long.
